description: How to style or construct icons for the Guelph design system

---

Icons are a unique beast, so it's important to define how to use and create icons for the design system. Currently we use [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) linkages as well as external [Material Design icon](https://materialdesignicons.com/) calls to build our icon library - in the future we hope to include a designated icon library.

For direction on *how* to use these icons, please refer to the [Icon component page]({{ "/components/icons/icons" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
