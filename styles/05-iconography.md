description: How to style or construct icons for the Guelph design system

---

Icons are a unique beast, so it's important to define how to use and create icons for the design system. Currently we use [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) linkages as well as external [Material Design icon](https://materialdesignicons.com/) and [Font Awesome icon](https://materialdesignicons.com/) calls to build our icon library - in the future we hope to include a designated icon library. Our priority at the moment is to avoid using Font Awesome icons. The best icon you can use is an custom one, added to our icon assets library, then a Material Design icon, and finally an Icon8 icon.

For direction on *how* to use these icons, please refer to the Icon component page.
