description: The attributes that make up the City of Guelph branding
---

Styles are guidelines for core City of Guelph brand attributes, organized by category. These are descriptions of conventions that cut across component and suggest the rules that go into building/designing components and their treatment. Like the [guidelines]({{ "/guidelines/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), each of these pages is effectively a reference article on how to use and approach the specific subject area.
