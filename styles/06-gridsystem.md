The primary grid system that is utilized by guelph.ca is the Bootstrap 3 Grid System. It includes predefined classes for easy layout options as well as mixins for varying screen sizes. For more information on using the grid system, please visit [the Bootstrap 3 Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#grid).

It is worth noting, that since the advent of CSS3, `flexbox` and `css grid` are also valuable tools in creating dynamic and predefined formats and grids.
