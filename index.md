The City of Guelph Design System is an **open-source** design system built for Guelph based digital services. It acts as a living document to provide guidance on how to properly apply our internal policies and procedures. Working towards efficient Digital Services in the City requires synchronicity between our all of our departments, as well as proper communication between our users, authors, editors, reviewers, designers, developers, and system administrators.


Use this design system to provide a more usable, consistent and trustworthy online experience for people who access the City of Guelph's digital services.

## Contributing
The more eyes and edits we receive on this document the better! Our aim is to first have policies and procedures formally defined so that their explicit implementation can be provided here. In general we are **always** looking for recommendations on how we can make this system better, features we can add, and bloat that can be removed. For more information on how to contribute please visit the [Contribution page]({{ "/contribute" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
