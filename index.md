The City of Guelph Design System is a design system built for Guelph based digital services. It acts as a living document to provide guidance on how to properly apply our internal policies and procedures. Working towards efficient Digital Services in the City requires synchronicity between our all of our departments, as well as proper communication between our users, authors, editors, reviewers, designers, developers, and system administrators.

Use this design system to provide a more usable, consistent and trustworthy online experience for people who access the City of Guelph's digital services.
