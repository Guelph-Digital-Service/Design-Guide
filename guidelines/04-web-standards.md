## Usability and UX Design (W3 & WHATWG)
To "Write once, deploy everywhere" was the great goal of the web standards movement. Thanks to the efforts of web designers & browser vendors supporting web standards, usability and accessibility are far easier today than they ever have been. The W3C and WHATWG are groups that debate "What the web should be", argue over APIs and publish standards for browser vendors and developers to implement. These are open groups, anyone interested enough in them can contribute.
- [W3](http://www.w3.org/TR/)
- [WHATWG](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/)
- [Canadian Digital Service](https://digital.canada.ca/)

At the City of Guelph, we don't want to reinvent the wheel. We follow the guidance of the leaders in this space, and base our design system heavily on the Canadian Digital Service which has worked to implement overarching web strategies into a governmental framework.
