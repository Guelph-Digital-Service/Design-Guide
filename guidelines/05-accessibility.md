description: Our goals and minimum standards for digital accessibility


---


Our goal is for our web content to be as accessible as possible! Ideally, we strive for **AODA AAA** compliance, but require that our new content comply with **AODA AA** standards at a minimum. This design system conforms to full AAA standards, however WCAG errors can still be introduced to systems through content or implementation, therefore it is important to give the [Accessibility of Ontarions with Disabilities Act](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/05a11) and the [2.1 Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) a good read!

## Notes for Authors
- ALL images that you've added to your post or page must have descriptive alternative text associated with them.
- If you are including a link in your content, make sure the link text is specific. Don't use phrases like "Learn more", "More information", or "Click here"
- If you are linking to a document, make sure to use the pretty link component!
- Be cautious of overusing buttons in place of links - our aim is to provide a content driven website to our users to aid in navigation of our services.

## Notes for Webmasters and Developers
- You can use the `sr-only` class to hide things from regular view but show them for Screen Readers!
