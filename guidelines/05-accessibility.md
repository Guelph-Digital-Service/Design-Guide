description: Our goals and minimum standards for digital accessibility


---


Our goal is for our web content to be as accessible as possible! Ideally, we strive for **AODA AAA** compliance, but require that our new content comply with **AODA AA** standards at a minimum. This design system conforms to full AAA standards, however WCAG errors can still be introduced to systems through content or implementation, therefore it is important to give the [Accessibility of Ontarions with Disabilities Act](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/05a11) and the [2.1 Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) a good read!
