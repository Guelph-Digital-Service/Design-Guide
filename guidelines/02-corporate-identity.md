description: Corporate Identity guidelines for all City of Guelph public content


---

When properly applied to all corporate documents, a corporate identity is a powerful statement about who we are as an organization. As part of a corporate-wide commitment to professional communications and branding, these guidelines provide staff and suppliers of the City of Guelph with clear, consistent direction on the use of the logo and supporting corporate identity elements such as typefaces, colours and placement. When developing brochures, flyers, maps, signs, memoranda, faxes, or related communications and marketing material whether for internal or external use, the directives outlined in this document should be followed. The logo is the corporate identity of the City and is restricted to City of Guelph corporate activities. If you have any questions, require further information about the use of the City of Guelph logo, or require digital versions of the logo or slogan, please contact your departmentâ€™s Communications Co-ordinator or email communications@guelph.ca

The Corporate Identity Guidelines provide steadfast requirements for ALL city documentation, though pieces of the document have been including in this digital design guide as well.
