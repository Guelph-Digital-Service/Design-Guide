description: Guidelines that explain which browsers the City of Guleph design system is supported and optimized for


---

Our own user logs are almost all that matters in deciding which browsers we officially support. However, if we give our clients good reason to upgrade or switch to a newer, more standards compliant browser our jobs will be easier and our work higher quality as we won't need to be spending time fixing bugs in older browsers.

**Do web sites need to look the same in every browser?**
No. A page needs to serve its purpose in function and not appear broken. It's not about browsers, it's about serving the users of our software by delivering content that is valuable to them.

In general, there is a difference between support and optimization in terms of browsers;

## Support
We currently provide support for the latest version of all modern browsers including;
- Microsoft Edge
- Firefox
- Chrome
- Safari
- Opera

## Optimization
Our developers utilize Firefox and Chrome as their primary browsers, and most of our digital services are optimized for these browsers.

## Mobile Support
