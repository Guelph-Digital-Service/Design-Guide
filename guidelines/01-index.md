The following guidelines are where you'll find UX, design and development guidance for specific aspects of City of Guelph digital assets and services. These provide high-level tours of the relevant components and styles, with links to the specific pages in the components and styles sections for more detailed guidelines on each element. Each of the following guidelines is effectively an article on the proper usage of City of Guelph design components and procedures.

The guidelines were derived from pre-formulated City of Guelph policies/procedures as well as commonly utilized web and design guidelines such as [YellowShoe](https://yellowshoe.com.au/standards/#html), [CodeGuide](https://codeguide.co/#html), and [Gravity Dept](https://manuals.gravitydept.com/code/css).
