# Guelph Digital Service Design Guide

[Visit the guide](http://Guelph-Digital-Service.github.io/GDS-Design-Guide/)

The Guelph Digital Service Design Guide is the foundation for design work on Guelph.ca and extended websites. As we collaboratively work towards a more usable, accessible, and secure website we will standardize our approach through the use of this living document. Many of our design choices have been based off the [Canada Design System](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/about/design-system.html) produced by the Canadian Digital Service and the Guide itself utilizes the [Style Guide Guide boilerplate](https://github.com/bradfrost/style-guide-guide/).
