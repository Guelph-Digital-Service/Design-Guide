## Authors
The City of Guelph digital design system is administered/maintained by the [WebServices department](mailto:webservices@guelph.ca) as well as the Guelph Digital Service. The original compilitation and development of the system was done by [Nic Durish](mailto:nic.durish@guelph.ca). Editors of this design system include; [Nic Durish](mailto:nic.durish@guelph.ca), [Greg Hahn](mailto:greg.hahn@guelph.ca), and [Kim Lawrence](mailto:kim.lawrence@guelph.ca)

## Process
Currently, the City of Guelph design system is being built with an informal and collaborate process in which WebServices is taking specifications and requirements from departments. Ideally once a suitable foundation for the design system is built, future updates, feature additions, or bug fixes will be discussed within the Guelph Digital Services steering committee and with our testing group made of local community members. Ultimately however, the final decisions on revisions of this document are left with Guelph Digital Service. If you have a recommendation or would like to provide feedback on this system, please contact one of the authors listed above.

Since a design system is made up of component code, guidelines, documentation, design tools, and resources, there are a number of different processes for submitting changes to this system. The primary methods of editing this document itself are via the Forestry.io CMS or by directly committing changes to the [Github Directory](https://github.com/Guelph-Digital-Service/GDS-Design-Guide). To use these you will first need an account with appropriate permissions - if you would like to be added as an editor, please contact [WebServices](mailto:webservices@guelph.ca). More importantly however, changes to code must be pushed to the GDS-design-system directory to be utilized in guelph.ca and other relevant services. Please do not make explicit changes without collaborating with other authors.
