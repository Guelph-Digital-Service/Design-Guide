There will inevitably be people who help make and maintain the City of Guelph design system, and there will be people who will be users of this design system. There may be overlap between these two groups, but establishing the roles of makers and users is important nonetheless. The design system makers are the ones who create, maintain, and govern the system, and they need to work closely together to ensure that the system is smart, flexible, scalable, and addresses the needs of the users and business. The design system users are the teams across the organization who will take the system and employ its interface patterns to specific applications. Please consider whether you are more of a maker or a user in this context!
