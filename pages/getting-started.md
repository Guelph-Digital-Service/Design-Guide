## Conventions
Whether you are a developer or designer, if you are going to be coding along-side this design system - *please* start by learning more about our [guidelines]({{ "/guidelines/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).


## Webmasters and Designers
You will likely be using this documentation as a resource for how to keep styles consistent and how to implement specific components.Your attention should be directed to the [styles]({{ "/styles/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), [components]({{ "/components/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), and [page templates]({{ "/wptheme/templates" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) sections!

## Developers
You will mostly be maintaining and adding to the above mentioned sections, but you'll want to pay particular attention to the [components]({{ "/components/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), and [page templates]({{ "/wptheme/templates" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) sections.
