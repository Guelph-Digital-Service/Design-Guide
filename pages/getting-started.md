## Downloading
If you aren't working on a site or application that does not already have the City of Guelph Design System files or resources already included, then you'll need to start by downloading the systems that you'll be working with:

[Download Design System Files]({{ "/downloads" | prepend: site.baseurl }}){: .c-btn}
{: .txtcenter}


## Creating pages and using components
Provide information on how to properly link up design system files in order to create a basic "hello world" template. From there, describe the process of incorporating design system's components into the project. Again, this will undoubtedly vary based on the setup and technologies your organization utilizes.

## Code conventions
Whether you are a developer or designer, if you are going to be coding along-side this design system - *please* learn more about our [coding conventions]({{ "/guidelines/code" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
