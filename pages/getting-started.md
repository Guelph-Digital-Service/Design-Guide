## Downloading
If you aren't working on a site or application that does not already have the City of Guelph Design System files or resources already included, then you'll need to start by downloading the systems that you'll be working with:

[Download Design System Files]({{ "/downloads" | prepend: site.baseurl }}){: .c-btn}
{: .txtcenter}



## Conventions
Whether you are a developer or designer, if you are going to be coding along-side this design system - *please* start by learning more about our [corporate identity]({{ "/guidelines/corporateidentity" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), [AODA standards]({{ "/guidelines/accessibility" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), and each of the other [guidelines]({{ "/guidelines/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).



## Authors
If you are an author using this design system, you'll want to direct your attention to the [styles]({{ "/styles/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) and [components]({{ "/components/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) sections, and give extra attention to those [writing guidelines]({{ "/guidelines/writing" | prepend: site.baseurl }})!


## Webmasters
Most of your attention should lie within the [styles]({{ "/styles/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), *components*, *dev components*, and [page templates]({{ "/wptheme/templates" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) sections!

## Developers
You will mostly be maintaining and adding to the above mentioned sections, but you'll want to pay particular attention to the *dev components*, [page templates]({{ "/wptheme/templates" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), and [custom post types]({{ "/wptheme/custom-post-types" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
